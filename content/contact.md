While I am living in Boston (Now through July 31, 2019), if you would like a signed and personalized copy of either PACHINKO or FREE FOOD FOR MILLIONAIRES, please order it from Harvard Book Store [https://shop.harvard.com/book/9781455563920](https://shop.harvard.com/book/9781455563920 "https://shop.harvard.com/book/9781455563920"). Before you finish your order, a Comments box will appear. Please write in the Comments box that you would like the book personalized and/or signed. Please use the online ordering system and note that all orders are pre-paid and non-refundable. The store will reach out to me, and I will sign the book and they will ship it to you.
