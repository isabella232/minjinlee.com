description: '"Han Kang, the South Korean writer who won the Man Booker International
  Prize in 2016 for her novel The Vegetarian, was nine years old in 1979 when a new
  military regime came to power in South Korea after a coup. Her family had just sold
  their house in Gwangju, where she had been born and raised, and moved to Seoul.
  The family that purchased it had two sons. Hanâ€™s father, a teacher, knew the younger
  of the two, a fifteen-year-old middle school student named Dong-ho." (To read, please
