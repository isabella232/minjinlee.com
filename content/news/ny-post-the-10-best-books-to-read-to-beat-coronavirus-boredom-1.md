> _Packinko_, Min Jin Lee
>
> "With the epic sweep of Zola or Dickens, Lee chronicles four storied generations of a Korean immigrant family, beginning with a pregnant young womanâ€™s decision to enter a marriage of convenience that ferries her to a new beginning in Japan. Her decision to leave home echoes across generations, all of it playing out against the rich tapestry of an ever-changing 20th-century Japan. The sheer bigness of this novel is majestic, as are its themes of joy, sacrifice, and heartbreak."
