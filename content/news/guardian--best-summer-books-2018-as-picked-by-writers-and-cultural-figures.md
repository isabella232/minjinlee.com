description: "Viet Thanh Nguyen: \n\nLuis Alberto Urrea’s The House of Broken Angels
  (Little, Brown) is a great American novel, if we understand “America” to be all
  of the Americas, including Mexico. It’s profane, funny and moving. Sayaka Murata’s
  Convenience Store Woman (Portobello, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori) takes
  a universal space, the convenience store, and turns it into the setting for a darkly
  comic (and very short) novel about alienation and identity in an urban, capitalist
  society. Alexander Chee’s How to Write an Autobiographical Novel (Mariner) is a
  collection of essays about race, writing, politics, queerness and sexuality that
  is urgent and insightful. I’ll be in Paris for much of the summer, and I’ll be takingÉdouard
  Louis’ The End of Eddy (Vintage, translated by Michael Lucey), Leila Slimani’s Lullaby
  (Faber), Han Kang’s The Vegetarian (Portobello), Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko (Head of
  Zeus), Lisa Ko’s The Leavers (Dialogue) and Jenny Zhang’s Sour Heart (Bloomsbury)."
