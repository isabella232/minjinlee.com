description: 'The 2018 Dayton Literary Peace Prize Runner-Up in Fiction:  In Pachinko
  (Grand Central), Min Jin Lee brings the historical sweep of Dickens and Tolstoy
  to the saga of four generations of a poor Korean immigrant family who, exiled from
  a homeland they never knew, fight to control their destinies in 20th-centuryJapan.
  As they encounter both catastrophes and great joy, the novel''s exceptional protagonists
  confront enduring questions of faith, family, and identity.  Lee said: “The world
  is broken because we do not love enough. War, peace, and art require at least three
  elements: imagination, will, and action – and ironically, all three are enacted
  because men and women feel love. This is the central paradox – we love – the other,
  self, family, faith, or nation – and we use that love – of something, or someone,
  for anything – to justify our violence, compromises, and creation. We know that
  peace is far more difficult than war or art, because peace requires both forgiveness
  and restraint; so somehow, we must learn to love peace far more than war. If literature
  bears witness to true narrative and if it awakens compassion, reconciliation may
  indeed be possible. Where men and women have failed to love, literature may inspire
  greater love for all those we''d once thought we feared or hated. I write fiction
  because I believe that our love can refine our worse nature. I am deeply honored
  to join the Dayton Literary Peace Prize family of writers as we pursue our collective
  call toward global peace."'
