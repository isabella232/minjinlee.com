> _Pachinko_ "offers a cross-generational look at 20th-century Japan through the eyes of impoverished Korean immigrants. The heartbreaking saga, set in the 1930s, begins when a young Korean woman, impregnated by a rich but married lover, enters a union of convenience with an ill minister. She follows him to Japan, effectively rebooting her life and everything she’s ever known. This is a stormy and powerful story about immigrant sacrifice, with undercurrents of compassion and steely female strength."
