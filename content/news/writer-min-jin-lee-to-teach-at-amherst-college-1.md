description: The author Min Jin Lee RI '19 asks, "Who are the modern Koreans, and
  what do they care about?" To answer this enormously complex question, Lee explores
  the will of Koreans to survive and flourish as global citizens, their enduring faith
  in education, and the costs of such a quest and what it may mean to the larger world
  they seek to engage. She explains that when she's writing, she isn't just writing
  about Koreans, education, or the diasporaâ€”she's writing about humans.
