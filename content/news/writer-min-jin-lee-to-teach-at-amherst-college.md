description: “I’ve been asked why I write about Koreans,” Lee said. “And it seems
  like such a strange question. Because why wouldn’t I write about Koreans? To me,
  Koreans are mothers and fathers and daughters and sons, which means Koreans are
  like us; we are worthy of consideration and reflection."
