description: '"This is a captivating book I read at the suggestion of a young staffer
  on my team –– a historical novel about the Korean immigrant experience in wartime
  Japan. Min Jin Lee draws you in from the first line, ''History has failed us, but
  no matter.'' The book is named after a popular game in Japan that''s a bit like
  a pinball machine –– a game of chance where the player can set the speed or direction,
  but once it''s in play a maze of obstacles determines the outcome. Staying true
  to the nature of the game, Min Jin Lee''s novel takes us through four generations
  and each character''s search for identity and success. It''s a powerful story about
  resilience and compassion." - Barack Obama'
