description: This week, I’ve got a literary recommendation that lines up with our
  joy and wonder theme, sort of. It’s “Pachinko,” the novel by Min Jin Lee, which
  chronicles four generations of an ethnic Korean family, first in Japanese-occupied
  Korea in the early 20th century, then in Japan itself from the runup to World War
  II and beyond.  It doesn’t sound like fun, but our critics selected it as one of
  best books of 2017 and there’s a humanity and warmth to the story, writing and characters
  that makes it feel like a cozy warm blanket (as my very smart wife put it).  I’m
  not quite finished yet, but I agree. It’s a family saga more about human connections
  than history, even as conflict and occupation intervene.
