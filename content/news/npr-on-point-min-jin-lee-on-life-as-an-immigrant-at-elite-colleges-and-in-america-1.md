description: '"Sometimes my therapist, bless her, mentions phobias I don’t have. ''You’re
  not an agoraphobe,'' she offered on Wednesday. But nevertheless, I am skeptical
  of crowded opinions. Books loved by enormous groups of people unnerve me. I skirted
  WOLF HALL for ages, and the number of people who told me PACKINKO is a good book
  is equal to the number of times I responded, ''Oh, I have to read that,'' and then
  didn’t. I shouldn’t have hesitated. Min Jin Lee began her career as a lawyer, and
  her interest in research and justice shines through this compelling family narrative.
  It is sweeping but specific. When my reading lamp putters out­—the only way I can
  close the book at night—words and images last: Sunja’s simplest chima, or the way
  her mother cuts radishes in perfect cubes. Huge cultural questions also sweep past,
  not unanswered but unanswerable: How do communities thrive on each other’s exclusion?
  How can a people flourish when their equity is rejected? This book is so much about
  the collective, its fragility and its dangers, paper-thin walls and the thickness
  of blood." —Julia Berick'
