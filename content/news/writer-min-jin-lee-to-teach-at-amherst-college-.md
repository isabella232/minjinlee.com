description: "“I was a history major when I was an undergraduate, and I had no intention
  of becoming a novelist; however, I loved the few writing classes I took for fun,
  and I think feeling uninhibited yet becoming more skilled as a young writer was
  significant to my personal maturation, not just as a professional writer, but even
  when I practiced law and for all of my personal correspondence,” she said in an
  email interview. “Being a strong writer has always been very important to me, and
  I hope to share this value … Above all, I would like to create a welcoming space
  for non-writers and advanced writers to take greater risks in their written expression.”
  \ She hopes to help students “fall in love with the generative process,” she said.
  “Each draft teaches us more about what we want to say, and I would be happy if my
  students learned to see that in their work — that with their efforts, they are approaching
  who they are, what they want to say, and what they care about.”"
