description: '"Min Jin Lee discussed her process and interests, and reflected on the
  hardships of being a professional artist, especially as a woman of color. She also
  described the impact of receiving a NYSCA/NYFA Artist Fellowship: ''I needed to
  have this kind of support that somehow what I did mattered. And that was so important
  to have NYFA recognize that my little question was worth supporting, and I think
  that when the average person in this country thinks that art matters, that''s a
  huge step. Because it is so often seen as less important than food, and housing,
  and jobs, and healthcare, and all those things are really important for me, too.
  But I chose this path because I think that literature can create the level of empathy
  that many things cannot. I believe that, I believe that with everything that I do.''"'
