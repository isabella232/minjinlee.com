> "Very rarely do I get to throw myself into a book that makes me feel so seen. Through protagonist Casey Han, Min Jin Lee perfectly articulates what it feels like to find yourself battling between two cultures as you try to navigate young adult life in New York City. _Free Food for Millionaires_ is beautifully written and filled with characters you will love, hate and learn from." â€” _Diane J.
