description: '"''Pachinko'' is one of those family sagas that you get lost in, forgetting
  the passage of time, disappearing into places far away — a poor fisherman’s cramped
  lodging house; a fragrant restaurant kitchen where kimchee is crafted; a noisy pachinko
  parlor; a hospital room where generations become linked. ''Sweeping'' and ''epic''
  are words that are always applied to books like this, but they fit; you leave ''Pachinko''
  feeling changed, as if your world got a little bigger."'
