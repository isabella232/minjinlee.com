  "With warmth, candor, and startling insight, Nicole Chung tells of her search for the people who gave her up, which coincided with the birth of her own child. ALL YOU CAN EVER KNOW is a profound, moving chronicle of surprising connections and the repercussions of unearthing painful family secrets-vital reading for anyone who has ever struggled to figure out where they belong.

  Join us in the Rare Book Room as Nicole discusses her new book with fellow author Min Jin Lee!"
