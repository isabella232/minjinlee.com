description: 'Clare Clark hosts a unique conversation between two acclaimed Korean-
  American writers: Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko – one of The New York Times 10 Best Books
  of 2017 – is an epic tale of family, identity, love, death and survival set between
  Korea and Japan across eight decades and four generations. Mary Lynn Bracht’s White
  Chrysanthemum is a heartbreaking story of the treatment of Korean women prostituted
  by Japanese soldiers during WW2 and the redemptive bond of two sisters separated
  by war.'
