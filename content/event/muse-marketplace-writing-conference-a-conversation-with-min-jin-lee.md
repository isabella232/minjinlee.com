description: 'Join a fascinating Q&A with Min Jin Lee, author of Pachinko, on writing stories that span large swaths of time and geography. What are the uniques challenges of such a large scope? How to transition through huge leaps in time or location? How to sustain tension in a book that requires many hours to read? What research might be required, and how can you keep track of it all? And do epic stories take an epic time to write?'
