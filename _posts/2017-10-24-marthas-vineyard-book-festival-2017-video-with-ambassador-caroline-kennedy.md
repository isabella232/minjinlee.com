This past summer, I had the great honor of being introduced by Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, who is so very cool and fun, at the MV Book Festival. &nbsp;Thanks to Amb. Caroline Kennedy, the Martha's Vineyard Book Festival, its valiant founder Sullen Lazarus, the great volunteers of the festival, and of course, Bunch of Grapes, independent bookstore extraordinaire.
