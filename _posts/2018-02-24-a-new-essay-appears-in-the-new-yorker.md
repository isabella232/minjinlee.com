> During the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, I didn’t expect to cry when athletes from two Koreas marched as one into the stadium, carrying the flag of unification, but tears filled my eyes. It was as if my body couldn’t be stopped from remembering some unspent grief. The twenty-third Winter Olympics are closing out their second week, and the Games may yet live up to their billing as the “Olympics of peace.” A joint Korean women’s ice-hockey team went winless in five attempts, but the images of athletes from the North and South playing alongside one another will be slow to fade. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, also invited the South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, to Pyongyang for a summit.

["After the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, Healing the Deepest Fracture"](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/after-the-pyeongchang-winter-olympics-healing-the-deepest-fracture)&nbsp;appeared in the New Yorker on February 24th.&nbsp;
