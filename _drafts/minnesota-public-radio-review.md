Every week, The Thread checks in with booksellers around the country about their favorite books of the moment. This week, we spoke with Josie Danz, a manager at Zandbroz Variety in Fargo, N.D.

Josie Danz grew up in the bookstore â€” Zandbroz is a family business.

Lately, she's been recommending "Pachinko," a new novel by Min Jin Lee.

It's a sweeping family saga set in Korea and Japan. The story spans nearly the entire 20th century, following four generations through colonial rule, war and dislocation.
