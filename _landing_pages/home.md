> “A deep, broad, addictive history of a Korean family in Japan enduring and prospering through the 20th century.”

**—David Mitchell, New York Times bestselling author of *The Bone Clocks*, *Cloud Atlas*, and *Black Swan Green***

---

> “Astounding. The sweep of Dickens and Tolstoy applied to a 20th century Korean family in Japan. Min Jin Lee's *Pachinko* tackles all the stuff most good novels do—family, love, cabbage—but it also asks questions that have never been more timely. What does it mean to be part of a nation? And what can one do to escape its tight, painful, familiar bonds?”

**—Gary Shteyngart, New York Times bestselling author of *Little Failure* and *Super Sad True Love Story***

---

> “If proof were needed that one family's story can be the story of the whole world, then *Pachinko* offers that proof. Min Jin Lee's novel is gripping from start to finish, crossing cultures and generations with breathtaking power. *Pachinko* is a stunning achievement, full of heart, full of grace, full of truth.”

**—Erica Wagner, author of *Ariel's Gift* and *Seizure***

> “Both for those who love Korea, as well as for those who know no more than Hyundai, Samsung and kimchi, this extraordinary book will prove a revelation of joy and heartbreak. I could not stop turning the pages, and wished this most poignant of sagas would never end. Min Jin Lee displays a tenderness and wisdom ideally matched to an unforgettable tale that she relates just perfectly.”

—**Simon Winchester, New York Times bestselling author of *The Professor and the Madman* and *Korea: A Walk through the Land of Miracles***

> “In 1930s Korea, an earnest young woman, abandoned by the lover who has gotten her pregnant, enters into a marriage of convenience that will take her to a new life in Japan. Thus begins Lee's luminous new novel *Pachinko* -a powerful meditation on what immigrants sacrifice to achieve a home in the world. *Pachinko* confirms Lee's place among our finest novelists.”

**—Junot Díaz, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of *The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao* and *This Is How You Lose Her***

> “Pachinko by Min Jin Lee is a great book, a passionate story, a novel of magisterial sweep. It’s also fiendishly readable—the real deal. An instant classic, a quick page-turner, and probably the best book of the year.”

**—Darin Strauss, National Book Critics Circle Award-winning author of *Half a Life* and *Chang & Eng***
